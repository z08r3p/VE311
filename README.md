1.    Please   use   A4   size   paper   or   page.
2.    Please   clearly   state   your   final   result   for   each   question.
3.    Please   state   and   verify   the   operating   region   (cutoff,   FAR/active,   or   saturation)   of   each   BJT.
Problem   1An   npn   transistor   of   a   type   whose   β    is   specified   to   range   from   50   to   300   is   connected   in   a   circuit   with   emitter   grounded, collector   at   +10   V,   and   a   current   of   10   µA   injected   into   the   base.   Calculate   the   range   of   collector   and   emitter   currents   that   can   result.      What   is   the   maximum   power   dissipated   in   the   transistor?
(Note:      Perhaps   you   can   see   why   this   is   a   bad   way   to   establish   the   operating   current   in   the   collector   of   a   BJT.)
Problem   2A   very   simple   circuit   for   measuring   β   of   an  代 写VE311 Electronic Circuit HW3Java
代做程序编程语言 npn   transistor   is   shown   in   Fig   1.    In   a   particular   design,   VCC       is   provided   by   a   9-V   battery;   M   is   a   current   meter   with   a   50-µA   full   scale   and   relatively low resistance that you can neglect for our purposes here.    Assuming that the transistor   has   VBE   =0.7 V   at   IE   =1mA, what   value   of   RC      would   establish   a   resistor   current   of   1   mA?   Now,   to what value of β   does   a meter   reading   of full   scale   correspond?    What is   β   if the   meter   reading   is   1/5   of full   scale?    1/10   of full   scale?

Problem   3For   the   circuit   in   Fig   2, find   VB      and   VE      for   vI      =   0V,   +2V,–2.5V,   and   –5V.   The   BJTs   have   β=50.

Problem   4
For   the   circuit   shown   in   Fig.   3,   find   the   labeled   node   voltages   for:
(a)   β   =   ∞;
(b)   β   =   100;
