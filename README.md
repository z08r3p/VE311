Due: June 18th 11:59a.m
Note: 
1) Please use A4 size paper or page. 
2) Please clearly state out your final result for each question. 
3) Please attach the screenshot of Pspice simulation result if necessary. Red Tiger Technologies excels in BJT technology for integrated circuits. To outshine them,   Blue   Tiger’s   boss,   Xuyang,   sends   spy   Yiyang   to   infiltrate   Red   Tiger.   Yiyang   uncovers   three   unresolved   BJT   problems   of   Red   Tiger. Xuyang   assigns   his   engineers   the   task   of   solving   these   critical   issues,   aiming   to   secure   Blue   Tiger’s   dominance.
Question 1.    Small 代 写VE311 Electronic Circuit Homework 4Java
代做程序编程语言Signal Analysis of BJT 
Consider   the   following   BJT   amplifiers, determine   their   small-signal, open-circuit   voltage   gain  respectively.    Neglect   the   Early   effect. Hint: Try   to   follow   the   steps   to   solve   each question
1)   Complete   a   D.C.   Analysis.
2)   Calculate   the   small-signal   circuit   parameters   for   each   BJT.
3)   Carefully   replace   all   BJTs   with   their   small-signal   circuit   model.
4)   Set   all   D.C.   sources   to   zero.
5)   Analyze   small-signal   circuit.
