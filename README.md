However,   to   fully   grasp   the   behavior   of electronic   circuits,   Peilin   needs   to   extend   his   knowl-edge   to   include   the   small-signal   model. This   is   crucial   for   analyzing   how   the   output   signal   reacts   to   variations   in   the   input   signal. This   transition   marks   Peilin’s   next   challenge   in   the   homework.
Question 1.    Small Signal of MOSFET 
Initially, Peilin   needed   to   learn   to   draw   small-signal   circuits   and   understand   the   parameters   of   their   components. The   circuit   shown   below   is   a   MOSFET   cascode   amplifier. The   next   challenge   Xuyang   hands   Peilin   is   to   draw   the   small   signal   model   and   derive   Rout for   the   amplifier.   Assume transistors M1 and M2      are in   saturation   and   include   rO in the   calculation. 

Question 2.    Common-Source with Resistive Load When dealing with weak signals, such as microphone amplifiers or   signal   conditioning   circuits   for other sensing devices, common-source MOSFET amplifiers are often used as the first stage   of   amplification   because   of   the   high   voltage   gain   they   can   provide.    In   his   final   task,   Peilin   must   optimize   a   common-source   amplifier   with   a   resistive   load.    Assume   λ   =   0   and   γ    =   0.   For   VDD         =   5V   ,   Vin         =   0.9   V   +   small   signal,   RD         =      15kΩ   and   Ldrawn         =   2µm,   find   out   the value   Wdrawn      to   obtain   a   voltage   gain      |Av |      >   10   and   VOUT       (the   DC   biasing   voltage   at   the   output)   close   to   2.5V   as   much   as   possible.

He   had   met   all   the   challenges   Xuyang   had   thrown   at   him,   from   understanding   MOSFET   biasing   in   Homework   5   to   mastering   the   in-   tricacies   of small-signal   analysis   and   amplifier   optimization   in   Homework   6.In   a   brief yet   significant   meeting,   Xuyang   reviewed   Peilin’s   work.    “Excellent job,   Peilin,”   Xuyang   said   with   a   nod   of   approval.      “Your   understanding   of   MOSFET   technology   is   im-      pressive,   and   your   solutions   demonstrate   both   precision   and   creativity.”Peilin   felt   a   surge   of   pride. He   had   not   only   completed   the   tasks   but   had   also   deepened   his   understanding   of crucial   electronic   concepts. More   importantly,   he   had   proven   his   value   to   Blue   Tiger   Electronics.As   Peilin   left   Xuyang’s   oﬀice, he   looked   forward   to   the   new   challenges   ahead. With   a   renewed      sense      of   confidence, he knew he   was ready   to   tackle   whatever came next in his   journey   as   an   engineer   at   Blue   Tiger   Electronics.
