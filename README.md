Note:
1) Please use A4 size paper or page. 
2) Please clearly state out your final result for each question. 
3) Please attach the screenshot of Pspice simulation result if necessary. Peilin, a talented young engineer, has recently   joined Blue Tiger Electronics.       Peilin’s   demanding   supervisor,   Xuyang,   is   determined   to   outshine   their   rival   company, Red   Tiger   Technologies, and secure a prestigious   government contract   that   will ensure Blue Tiger’s   dominance   in   the   industry. To   achieve   this,   Xuyang   assigns   Peilin   a   series   of   challenging   tasks   to   demonstrate   Blue   Tiger’s   superior   MOSFET   technology.
Question 1. MOSFET DC Biasing Peilin meticulously works through the drain current equations shown below, knowing that   his   performance   on this task   is   crit代 写VE311 Electronic Circuit Homework 5

Assuming   µn       =   350   × 10−4m2   /V/s,   µp      =   350   × 10−4m2   /V/s,   VTH         =    0.7V    (NMOS),    VTH         =    −0.8V      (PMOS),    Wdrawn   /Ldrawn         =    20µm/2µm,    tox         =    9    ×   10−9m,   LD      = 0.08µm,   sketch   IX      of   M1      as   a   function   of   VX      increasing   from   0V   to   VDD      =   5V.
Question 2.    Combination of MOSFET Next,   Xuyang   assigns   Peilin   the   task   of analyzing   a   complex   circuit   involving   a   combination   of   MOSFETs.    For   the   circuit   below,   he   needs   to   determine   the   labeled   node   voltages.    The   NMOS   transistor   has   VTH      = 0.9V   ,   kn      = µn   Cox   (W/L)   =   1.5mA/V2   .
